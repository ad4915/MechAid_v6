<h1>CVs</h1> 
<p class="lead">
The purpose of this page is to provide unique and useful information with regards to writing CVs. The information contained here provides advice that is not easily available to obtain, be that online or even speaking to careers advice. As such, this page is not comprehensive as it is specifically aiming to provide unique information as opposed to common well-known information, and therefore it is assumed that you are aware of the basic skills of CV writing. There are plenty of resources available online to develop these basic skills.
</p>

<div class="border shadow-lg p-5 mb-4 bg-white mt-4">

<h3 id="exception">Layout</h3>
<p>The recommended format to layout your experience is in the following manner:
<br>
Position, Institution, Location. For example:
<ul>
<li>Summer Intern, Rolls-Royce, Bristol</li>
<li>Vice-captain, St Paul's School, London</li>
<li>Secretary, Imperial College London Robotics Society (Location is not necessary here as London is already mentioned in the institution name)
</ul> 

The position of the dates of activities listed on your resume is subjective and there is no correct position. It is arguably better to have them on the right side, as opposed to the left, as the date is less significant than what you actually did, and therefore the activity that you did should be read first perhaps, but this is subjective. 
</p>

<h3>Conciseness</h3>
<p>
In writing a CV, you should be as concise as possible. This applies for most things, but especially for CVs, because the average time spent reading a CV by employers is only 6 seconds. Therefore any lengthy descriptions, repetitions or waffle cannot exist in your resume. To achieve this, certain rules should be followed:
<ul> 
<li>Any word that if removed will provide the same information should be eliminated
<li>Use concise language - use action verbs wherever possible to help achieve this. People often talk about the skills that they developed from their activities listed e.g. ‘I developed my communication skills by delivering a presentation in front of 100 people on the  …' The same information and skills developed can be portrayed in a fraction of the words by simply saying ‘Presented to 100 people ...’. Employers are aware that working in a team delivers teamwork skills, and delivering presentations develops communication skills etc. so you do not need to spell it out for them! </li>
<li>Wherever possible, merge bullet points together - how do you know when it is appropriate to do so? If you are highlighting a different skill, then it is necessary to start a new bullet point. If it is the same skill being portrayed in two bullet points, then they need to be merged</li>
</ul>
As well as being concise with language and structure, it is also important to be concise with regards to how much content there is on your CV. One of the most common mistakes people make when writing a resume is that they try and cram as much as possible onto one page, to sell the wide range of activities they have undertaken and to omit as few things as possible. Less is more. The more things you add on your CV doesn’t improve it because a resume is judged based on quality, not quantity. By adding something less powerful than what is already on there, the ‘score’ of your CV out of 10 will not increase just because it is an extra thing, but will decrease because the average quality of all the activities listed has gone down by the new addition. Quality is not cumulative! With this in mind, make sure you only include the best parts of your experience. When you are in ME1, you will most likely have a CV that is quite empty so won’t have much of a choice as to what to include, but by the time you are in ME4, you will realise that some of the things on your CV can definitely be removed. As well as maintaining a high average quality of activities, keeping only the best parts is also important to make the CV aesthetically pleasing. Having a CV that is crammed with words right to the edge of the paper with very small font makes the CV difficult and unattractive to read. You need to ensure there is sufficient blank space to keep it looking clean and pleasant.
</p>


<h3>Selling Yourself</h3>
<p>
<!-- For a spring-week, it is more common for the final stage of the application process to be a telephone interview, or even a video-interview as opposed to in person. Given that the purpose of the spring-week is to give you an insight into investment banking, they do not expect you to have a huge amount of technical knowledge and as such competency and motivational type questions are more common. Brainteasers also pop-up from time to time. The following gives a very condensed and concise list of the topics you should aim to cover for an IBD interview. The list is not comprehensive (no list will be as they can ask anything) but this list covers the most important topics to prepare: -->
The whole purpose of a CV is to sell yourself in the best possible way, yet ironically students completely miss this, by being too modest about their achievements. It’s important to realise that there are multiple ways of describing the very same event or story, despite it being the very same event that is being described. The same applies to describing the activities on your CV; simply stating them for what they are isn’t good enough. You need to make an active effort to present yourself in the best possible light, by stretching your descriptions to make them sound as impressive as possible, which is often not how you may see them, but still ensuring you are not lying at any point. 
</p>

<h3>Self-Judgement</h3>
<p>Self-judgement is something that is very often done and not realised as a mistake in a CV. This is when you explicitly write that you are a great team player, or that you are excellent at MATLAB, or that you have fantastic leadership skills etc. You need to portray that you have all these characteristics, but not by stating them explicitly. You need to convey this image of yourself by the facts. A CV is meant to be entirely factual - as soon as you judge yourself you are no longer maintaining this as you are giving opinions. Even if you think you are stating a fact by saying that you are excellent at MATLAB because you genuinely think it is true as you were the only one in the year who got 100% in all their tutorials, progress test and final exam in MATLAB, and no one else in the year came even close to you, it just means you are fantastic relative to your cohort. The people working at the firm you are applying for, if it is a technical firm, are likely to be much better coders than you. There will be other applicants who are better coders than you, it is all relative. So state the fact that you got 100% overall in MATLAB, to help convey an image that you are fantastic at coding, but don’t make the mistake of explicitly stating it.  Often self-judging is gone unnoticed as it can be quite subtle e.g. you might state ‘made complex computer programmes and meticulous engineering drawings’ when describing your ME2 experiences. The words 'complex' and 'meticulous' show opinions. The same image that you are trying to convey by saying this, that you are skilled at programming and have good attention to detail can be portrayed much more effectively by saying “Made engineering drawings conforming to British Engineering Standards and created an aircraft navigation system.” There are no lies in this (you made a navigation programme as part of one of your ME2 tutorials).
</p>

<h3>Quantify</h3>
<p>Quantify wherever possible in your CV. This somewhat helps to convey a positive image without being self-judgemental. If you organised an event for your society and you think you did an incredible job, instead of stating that the event was a huge success, state how many people attended, how much the attendance increased by, what initiatives you specifically took that helped achieve this, how much money did the event make. Ultimately, words are all subjective, but numbers are not. There is no ambiguity in the amount of profit an event makes, but there is in stating that it was a large success.  
</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
One thing you should definitely include in your CV if you are in younger years of your degree, is the activities you have undertaken as part of your degree. Mechanical engineering students at Imperial often fail to realise how impressive what they do as part of their degrees is; not only is it in an incredibly tough degree with regards to workload, it is also very practical. Most universities don’t have the funding to offer manufacturing facilities that Imperial offers, such as the STW or Hackspace. Cambridge do but they chose to focus their course more so on theoretical aspects. The things you make as part of your ME2 design project and DMTs is very impressive, so don’t take it for granted just because everyone else in your year is also doing it. It is therefore worth adding a few bullet points on the activities you have undertaken as part of your degree within the education section of your CV. 
</p>

<p>
In the skills section of your CV, again be completely honest. Skills should be classified as either basic, intermediate or proficient. Alternatively, you may prefer to use the word ‘competent’ for all your software abilities. One definition of the word is “acceptable and satisfactory, though not outstanding” meaning you are not lying, but another definition is “having the necessary ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully” thus selling yourself in a very positive light without lying. It is very common to see students writing Microsoft Office as one of their software skills; this consists of Microsoft Access, OneNote, Outlook, Project, Publisher amongst others. Most likely you do not have software skills in all of them, so just state Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint and Word, as interviewers have picked up on this in the past. 
</p>

<p>
There are countless CVs in the department that spell MATLAB incorrectly as ‘MatLab’ or ‘Matlab’. One thing that is stressed so much in writing CVs is attention to detail and no spelling mistakes or errors, but this is one that is seen very often so make sure you spell it correctly. 
</p>

<p>
Other resources at your disposal may encourage you to write an introductory paragraph selling yourself. This is an area that we disagree on and advise against doing - the purpose of your CV is to be factual and state what you have achieved and done. An introductory paragraph doesn’t fit with this, may be self-judgemental and is unlikely to say anything that anyone else can say too.  
</p>

<p>
In the dates section, if there is an activity that you are still doing e.g. if you have a certain position on committee this year, write the date end as ‘present’ as opposed to when the activity is expected to end as it presents you in a better light as it shows you are still involved with things outside and are keeping yourself busy. The only exception to this is your degree; if you started the MEng course in 2018 don’t write 2018-present, write 2018-2022. This is because by writing 2022 it indicates to the employer whether you are a penultimate or final-year student etc. and means you don’t have to say this again elsewhere.
