<h1>Investment Banking</h1> 
<p class="lead">
The purpose of this article is to provide advice on how to secure a job or internship in investment banking. It aims to provide information that is often missed by students, which students wish they had known when starting their time at university.

<div class="border shadow-lg p-5 mb-4 bg-white mt-4">
<h3 id="TheProcess">The Process</h3>
<p>To secure a job in investment banking, it is important to be proactive from early on in your degree. Students often do not know which career path they wish to pursue until as late as ME4 (or even later) which means it is quite common for students who eventually decide to pursue investment banking to have missed some of the important stages of the application process. Whilst it is definitely advantageous if you know exactly which path you wish to follow right from ME1, if you do not, that is absolutely fine, and in fact, expected! By ME1, it is very unlikely that you will be 100% sure that investment banking is what you want to do. But if it is something that you are interested in or are considering, you should follow the stages of the application process for two main reasons:
<ol>
<li>If you don't, you may discover only in ME4 that investment banking is what you wish to pursue by which point you will have missed many of the crucial stages of the process and it will be much more difficult to land a job
<li>Although in a lot of industries people often do internships simply to boost their CV as opposed to see if it is for them, in investment banking however, internships are very much a two-way process. They are just as important for the employer to see if you are suitable for the job as it is for you to see if the job is suitable for you - why? Because investment banking is by no means for everyone. Many people turn down investment banking graduate offers after their experience during an internship despite being very passionate about this career path beforehand, often due to the notoriously long working hours or the mundane nature of the work</li>
</ol> 
</p>

<p>
<b>ME2</b>
<p>During ME2, the main aim is to secure what's called a 'spring-week'. These are typically 1-week unpaid insight programmes where you will gain an insight into investment banking, through a range of presentations, networking sessions and activities. Although the timing isn't ideal with Easter usually being used for catching up on countless tutorial sheets and lectures, it is something that has to be done, as doing a spring week has three main functions:
<ol>
<li> They show you are interested in investment banking from early on, and that you have a reasonable understanding of what the industry involves, both of which put you at an advantage when applying for summer internships which are more competitive to land.  
<li> Banks are increasingly trying to streamline their recruitment process; they are keen for their spring-week intake to be the ones on their summer internship programme and their summer interns to be the ones filling their graduate positions. As such, many banks now offer the opportunity to convert your spring-week into a summer internship if you are successful during your spring-week.  
<li> Even if you do not ultimately decide to pursue investment banking, it is still very valuable to have the name of an investment bank on your CV even if you are pursuing something else
</ol>
</p>
One common answer you are likely to find online is that you should do a spring-week to gain an insight into what the industry involves and see if it something for you. Our opinion is that this should be taken with a pinch of salt - this applies for a summer internship, but a spring-week lasts just a few days and you do not actually do any work during the programme. Most of the information you are provided with can easily be found online and the networking opportunities can easily be found elsewhere e.g. at Imperial's Finance and Consulting Fair etc. One thing they do offer, however, is the oportunity to learn more about the culture of a firm which you cannot find easily without actually being there. Some people may also say it gives you the opportunity to build your investment banking network - whilst this is true, most people do not actually know how to network effectively so we would advise to not be drawn into doing a spring-week for these two reasons alone.  
<br>
<br>

If you did not secure a spring-week, then do not worry! You are not at a disadvantage. Having a spring-week will give you an advantage for summer internship applications against those who haven't completed one, but by no means is it a requirement to have a spring-week, and numerous people secure summer internships without a spring-week. What is more important, however, is what you do during your ME2 summer. People often make the mistake of thinking that if they have a spring-week, they are sorted for summer applications. Do not be fooled into thinking this - what you do during the summer is much more valuable than completing a spring week - why? 
<ol>
<li>Spring-weeks last for only a few days, where as anything productive you undertake during the summer is likely to span over a few months
<li>It is important to realise that most people applying for investment banking are on 3-year courses (e.g. the typical economics degree), and it is mainly these people who you are competing with. Most people do not do anything productive during the summer after their first year at university, therefore if you have done something in your summer leading to ME2, you will be at a huge advantage over those on a 3-yeare course who have a 'gap' on their CV for this period  
</ol>

Although summer internships are much more important and timelier with respect to exams, do not apply for them in ME2 as you will simply not be considered as you are not a penultimate year student.  

</p>
<b>ME3</b>
<p>If you have reached ME3 and have already secured a summer internship, then you should enjoy the rest of your year and study hard. For the majority of you, however, you will still need to apply. The summer internships typically last 9-10 weeks and they offer very competitive salaries. Obtaining a summer internship is the single most important thing to help you land a full-time offer - why? As mentioned earlier, most banks like to fill their graduate positions with summer interns as the summer interns have essentially been interviewed for 9-weeks, compared to someone who is hired directly through a graduate application where they are only interviewed for a few hours. It is also like this as the summer interns already have a feel for the bank's people and culture and are somewhat settled in already. Applying directly for a graduate position is therefore very difficult, and converting an internship is the most likely way of landing a graduate offer. They are equally a very useful opportunity for you to assess whether or not investment banking is for you - unlike a spring-week that lasts only a few days, through a summer internship you can gauge a proper feel for what it is like to work in this industry as you actually get your own desk and carry out work for the others in your team.
</p>

<b>ME4</b>
<p>By ME4, if you are lucky you will have converted your summer internship, and finally secured a full time graduate offer! If you haven't, do not worry! If you have already completed a summer internship but failed to convert it, don't lose hope. If you discovered that investment banking is not for you, having an investment banking summer internship on your CV is extremely powerful and will significantly help you with applications for any other job. If the internship reaffirmed your decision to pursue a career in this industry, then it is advisable to apply for summer internships again <i>as well as</i> graduate jobs. The recommended course of action would be to apply for graduate jobs directly for the banks ranked 'inferiorly' to the one where you completed your summer internship, but to apply for summer internships at the banks 'superior'. If you are late to the process and have only just decided you want to pursue investment banking, then apply only for summer internships (skip spring-week applications) - it is almost impossible to secure a graduate job offer without a summer internship in investment banking, so don't waste time in applying for graduate jobs.

<h3 id="TipstoSecureanInternship">Tips to Secure an Internship</h3>
<p>
<ul> 
<li><b>Have an impeccable CV and cover letter -</b> banks get thousands of applications so you really need to stand out. See this section for a through guide to CVs and cover letters [insert hyperlink]. Although on that page I have said that cover letters are often not read and are somewhat less signfiicant, for spring-weeks they are really important as most people applying don't have any work expereince and thus have very similar resumes, and as such you need to be able to stand out by the motivation presented in your cover letter. 
<li><b>Be purposeful with networking -</b> events people often hear they should attend networking events to help them land a job and attend these events with that mindset but speaking to people for the sake of it will achieve nothing and will be a waste of time. When you attend these events you should have a purpose. You will read online that these events are useful for learning more about the industry/company but this is somewhat fickle, as the people you will be speaking to will be bias and have been sent to promote their company and encourage people to apply. So what you should actually be hoping to gain from this session is one or more of the following:
<ul>
<li>Write down the names of the bankers who attended this event from the banks you are planning on applying for. This is the simplest thing to achieve, as you do not even have to speak to them! Doing this will give you the opportunity to name-drop in your cover letter to help your application stand out and make your cover letter more tailored to the company. It also shows you made the effort to go out of your way to speak to someone from the firm. It will obviously help if you actually speak to them, as you can say what you learnt from them about the company's culture that made you apply, but it can be hard to speak to everyone so for those you missed you can always take their name and say you got a long well with them and learnt from them about .. and say something that you can find on the company's website 
<li>Do proper networking. People often claim after attending such events that they did some networking, but very few actually do it effectively, as many don't actually realise what doing it effectively means. The ultimate outcome of effective networking is for your application to be recommended to Human Resources (HR). This can be done in several ways but fundamentally it involves building a rapport with someone from the bank to the extent where they are willing to go out of their way to reccommend you. A typical process may involve speaking to a banker at such a networking event, and ending the session by asking for their business card. Following up on this a while later by e-mailing them and asking to meet for coffee or to speak on the phone, and hopefully, by the end of this conversation you will have bonded enough for them to reccomend you. At networking events, it may be useful to take several copies of your CV. You can ask for advice on it at the events to make it noticed and if it is impressive, it may help get a reccommendation. Effective networking is very difficult, and very few are actually able to execute this, so do not worry if this is something you are unable to pull off. Networking helps secure internships, but is not necessary by any means
</ul>
<li><b>Apply to <i>lots</i> of places -</b> often you will hear that it is quality not quantity, and as such you should apply to just a few places properly. With investment banking, this should not be applied. Applications can be very time consuming, but it is important to apply to lots of different places - these internships are extremely competitive, and you will maximise your chances by applying to lots of places. People very often get only one internship offer despite sending very similar applications to numerous banks. This one bank is often the likes of Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan too, suggesting that luck does play a significant part. Therefore to maximise your chances, it is best to apply to as many places as possible, but remember not to let the quantity of applications lower their quality. Often studetns only apply for the bulge brackets (there are roughly 10 of these), as these are the best-known ones and are perhaps more attractive and glamarous but don't limit yourself just to these. Apply for boutiques too; these are mini-investment banks that specialise in a certain sector. Boutiques have many advantages over bulge brackets, and some would pick them over bulge brackets for these reasons so do not neglect applying to these. Even if you will definitely pick a bulge bracket over a boutique, you may not have success with bulge brackets so apply to boutiques anyway.
<li><b>Attend company events -</b> during the application season, companies often hold events targeted for prospective students. Students often neglect such events, as they find them unhelpful and uninformative. Whilst this may very be true, do not make this mistake! Many such events are actually held on campus, and you should make every effort to attend as many of these. Yes, attending these for every bank is long and time-consuming, and you may very well find that the information you hear can easily be obtained online in a fraction of the time, but they are very important as simply your attendance at this event will get recorded and may significantly boost the strength of your application. Banks receive so many applications from Imperial students, most of whom have impeccable academics and have ticked the relevant criteria, and as such they find it very difficult to differentiate. Someone who has given up a few hours of their weekend to attend a firm specific event will very much help you stand out from the rest and will be noticed by HR. 
<li><b>Apply <i>as early as possible</i> -</b> you may have followed all of the above steps and have built a perfect application, but you will not secure any spring-weeks if you apply too late. This step is extremely important for this reason and should not be overlooked. This requires you to be aware of when all the applications open well in advance, and taking any steps beforehand to ensure you can submit applications swiftly once they open e.g. it is sensible to have your cover letters ready for different banks even before the applications open so that you do not waste any time in writing them once the applications have opened. Most banks recruit on a rolling basis, meaning they will recruit as people apply as opposed to waiting until the application deadline has passed. So do not be fooled into thinking you are early if there is still plenty of time left till the deadline, as even if this is the case, given the sheer volume of applicants there is a good chance all the places will have already been filled and you are wasting your time in applying. Some applications open as early as late August! Add link to efinancial deadlines.
</ul>

<h3 id="HowtoPrepareforSpring-weekInterviews">How to Prepare for Spring-week Interviews</h3>
<p>For a spring-week, it is more common for the final stage of the application process to be a telephone interview, or even a video-interview as opposed to in person. Given that the purpose of the spring-week is to give you an insight into investment banking, they do not expect you to have a huge amount of technical knowledge and as such competency and motivational type questions are more common. Brainteasers also pop-up from time to time. The following gives a very condensed and concise list of the topics you should aim to cover for an IBD interview. The list is not comprehensive (no list will be as they can ask anything) but this list covers the most important topics to prepare:
<ul>
<li><b>Motivation -</b> why investment banking as opposed to mechanical engineering? Why this division?
<li><b>Competency -</b> interviewers commonly ask to give examples of times when you have done something, and often they ask you something that is a variant to a typical question such as a time when you displayed teamwork. It is impossible to prepare an example for every possible question they can ask, but the key is to gather a handful of solid examples that can you can then apply to multiple questions. Make sure you have examples to cover leadership, teamwork, a time you've adapted to something and a time you've done something wrong. Prepare answers for these using the STAR technique, but ensure that you can tailor these to variants to these questions.   
<li><b>News -</b> like the previous point, it is not possible to learn every piece of news in the current climate - they key is to learn about the major events occurring (e.g. upcoming elections, referendums etc.) and be able to give your own opinion on them, and how they link to the financial world and perhaps to the investment bank you are applying for. This includes things such as upcoming elections or Sound overwhelmingly difficult? As well as this, learn at least one <i>financial</i> news and be able to talk about it and explain why it is of interest to you. There is an app called Finimize which we would reccommend for this - it gives you a short and simple to understand daily news update and links the events to the financial world. Common standalone questions that are often asked are what has been the impact of the financial crisis on investment banking, and what are the current challenges facing the finance industry
<li><b>Company information -</b> make sure you know the CEO of the company you are applying for, recent company news, the culture and values of the company, and be able to talk about a recent deal the company has been involved in
<li><b>Brainteasers -</b> these are much less common than the other questions but it is worth learning a few of the common ones as they pop up from time to time. You might think this can't really be prepared for, but they often ask ones that can be obtained by simply Googling investment banking brainteasers e.g. what angle do the hands of a clock make at 3:15?
</ul>
</p>

For summer internship interviews, the same will apply except you may be asked technical questions as well, depending on the bank. The American banks (Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corporation) in particular are known to ask very technical questions. The technical questions that they ask will depend on which division you apply for.
</p>
</div>

<!-- <ul> -->
<!-- <li><b>Valuation -</b> learn the three main valuation methods, especially DCF - you should be able to talk about th -->
<!-- <li><b>Accounting -</b> Learn the 3 financial statements, and   -->
<!-- <li><b>Merger Model -</b> -->
<!-- <li><b>LBO Model -</b> -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- In preparing these topics, instead of learning these topics inside out, it will be mich more useful if you search investment banking technical questions and learn the relevant answers to the questions you find on each topic area as this will be much more represenative of what you may get asked.  -->

<div class="border shadow-lg p-5 mb-4 bg-white mt-4">
<h3 id="Divisions">Divisions</h3>
<p>When you apply for positions you will have to select a division to apply for. If you are unsure, we would strongly advise you to apply for a front office role. Front office is the revenue generating section of the bank and has two main sub-divisions: invesstment banking division (IBD) or sales & trading (a.k.a markets). Why?
<ul>
<li>These roles are generally the highest paying ones in investment banking
<li>It is possible to 'downgrade' from front office to other positions, but much more difficult to move the other way, so if you are unsure it is best to start here 
</ul>
When people speak to Careers Advice, they are often directed to divisions that suit their personality and skill set and what they enjoy doing which may often be middle of back office roles. Whilst this sounds logical, it may ruin your career prospects; most people pursuing investment banking are doing so either for the money, or the exit-opportunities. So if you are applying for investment banking for one of these reasons which you most likely are, bear this in mind - just because you work in an investment bank doesn't mean you will be highly paid and have good opportunities; an investment bank consists of analysts, cleaners, managing directors, receptionists, vice presidents and security guards amongst numerous other positions. Clearly not all of these will be as well paid as each other so bear this in mind with the advice you are given!  
 
NB. Do not confuse investment banking division with investment banking - investment banking encompasses all the different divisions in the bank from back office to front office, whilst investment banking division is just one of these divisions.
