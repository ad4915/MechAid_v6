<h1>Module Selection</h1> 
<p class="lead">
The purpose of this page is to provide advice on how to go about making your module selections. The generic advice given on this page can be considered comprehensive and complete with regards to how to go about selecting your modules, although specific advice with regards to the aspects of each module should be consulted from people who have already completed the course or the course leaders themselves.

<h3 id="exception">Exams vs Coursework</h3>
<p>Some of you will undoubtedly love coursework and hate exams, some of you will be the completely opposite, whilst some might not have a preference at all, and the weightage of coursework on each module is something that you should definitely consider when making your module selections. Some exams are 100% coursework, whilst others have no coursework and are assessed purely by means of an exam. If you have a preference for coursework over exams, then naturally, you should pick modules that are coursework heavy. Having said that, you do not want to overload yourselves with non-stop deadlines so only take on as much as you think you can manage! The converse doesn’t really apply however. If you prefer exams, and you want to pick all exam modules, then go for it. You will have 7 exams after Easter (which will be more than most of your peers) but this is completely doable, and people have scored exceptionally well in all 7 – just remember in ME2 you had 9 exams in the summer, so there is no reason why doing 7 exams should scare you now. Having said that, bear in mind that you won’t have 3 weeks after Easter to revise unlike in ME2 – your exams will take place immediately after Easter. It would be wise to play it tactically by picking some modules which have exams in January (e.g. Managerial Economics) so you will get them out of the way and have less to revise over Easter. 
</p>

<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>If you don’t have any friends doing a certain module, your experience of that module will inevitably be less enjoyable. It also means if you are stuck (on coursework for example) you may lack people to ask for help and may therefore struggle. Having friends doing your course will make it extremely more enjoyable – obviously don’t pick a module you think you will hate just because all your friends are doing it but if you are someone who struggles to make new friends easily, then it might be worth trying to ensure you have at least one friend on each of the modules you are picking. It is also worth remembering that some modules involve group projects where you can often pick your own groups and doing this with your friends (assuming they are just as hard working) will likely make it much more fun. 
</p>

<!-- <h3>Examination Timetable</h3> -->
<!-- <p>This is something that almost everyone neglects when picking their modules. If you are picking majority exam-based modules, then you want to pick modules with a pleasant an exam timetable as possible. The reason this is often neglected is because you are never told what the upcoming exam timetable is going to be when making your choices. If you ask the UG office, they will tell you they are not sure what it is going to be yet. Whilst the UG office are correct in that it might vary, from our experience the exam timetable is almost identical every year. As such, here is a copy of the exam timetable from last year (20__/20__): chances are it will be the same next year! -->
<!-- </p> -->

<h3>Distribution between Terms & Years</h3>
<p>This is another factor that is often neglected - do not make the mistake of creating a large mismatch between your workload between first and second term. This mainly applies for ME3 than ME4. In ME3, your LRP will take up a fair amount of time and the deadline for that is in the final week of autumn term. DMT usually tends to demand considerably more work in spring term than in autumn term. You should consider both of these when selecting your modules. In ME4, as your final year project is an individual project, you have full control over it (as you aren’t relying on other team members) so you can finish the bulk of your entire FYP in first term if you wish, and some do this if they have very little workload in autumn compared to spring. Despite this, it is still much better to have an even workload as this may put too much pressure on you in autumn term to finish most of your FYP. 
</p>
<p>
You should also consider how you will distribute modules between ME3 and ME4. ME4 is believed to be tougher than ME3, so you may wish to ‘save’ your easier modules for ME4. In ME3 you may spend considerable time applying for internships and in ME4 you may spend even more time applying for jobs. These should also be considered. If you secure an internship, enjoy it, and convert it, you may not need to apply for jobs in ME4 however, so appreciate that there is uncertainty with these unknown factors. It is also worth realising that you if you bag as many marks as you can in ME3, then you can make life much less stressful for yourself in ME4, as you may need a very low mark to get a 2:1 or a 1st overall. You could then focus on job applications, or enjoy your last year of university if you have already secured one! If this appeals to you, it may be worth doing lots of easy modules in ME3, such that even in ME4 if you have to do tougher ones, you can be more relaxed as you won’t need to score very highly in them. 
</p>

<p>If you are someone who works very hard and believe you can achieve as high a 1st as possible, then it might be sensible to pick all exam based modules in ME3, and do coursework heavy modules in ME4 - why? It is not possible to obtain extremely high marks in coursework. No matter how good your coursework is, it is very difficult to score above 85% in coursework. In exams, however, it is different - if you answer every question correctly in an exam (which is possible and has been done in some modules), you will obtain 100% in that module. It is much easier to score extremely high marks in exams, than it is in coursework. To obtain average marks, however, it is much easier to score this through coursework. It requires much less time and effort to score between 60-70% in coursework then it is to obtain the same mark in an exam. Therefore if you pick all exam modules in ME3 and score very highly in them, you will need a low mark in ME4 to get a 2:1 or a 1st, so it might then make sense to pick lots of coursework modules in ME4, where you can obtain your required mark with minimal effort!
</p>

<h3>Career Prospects</h3>
<p>Obviously, some modules will prepare you better for certain career prospects than others. If you want to pursue a career in the nuclear industry for example, chose Introduction to Nuclear Energy. As well as this, you should consider that certain modules are necessary to be undertaken in ME3 for you to pick others in ME4 so bear this in mind.  
</p>

<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>
These are your final years of education, so you may wish to make the most of them, and pick something that you are interested in! Even if you can’t wait to finish this degree and education forever, once your job starts, even if you want to learn something new, you will likely not have time to so consider making the most of this opportunity where you are compelled to learn something and immerse yourself in a field you are passionate about. Having said that, if you are someone who struggles with this degree and you are not on track for at least a 2:1, you should probably put less emphasis on this criterion and focus more on ‘easy’ modules which will help you pick up your grade.  </p>
</p>

<h3>Ease</h3>
<p>Some modules are undoubtedly easier than others. Ease can be defined in multiple ways, however; some may say modules are easy because they have very high marks:effort ratios, whilst some might say a module is easy because it consistently gets very high mean marks every year, or some would say a module is easy if it not technically hard to understand, despite having huge amounts of work. So, if you hear someone say that a module is easy, dig deeper and find out what it is that is easy about them, as your definitions might be somewhat different.
</p>

<p>
Modules led by departments other than ME (Inter-Departmental eXchange (IDX) modules, business school modules etc.) are generally much easier than ME modules. They are often not as technically challenging, require less effort, and are easier to score well in. These are generally deemed to be easier than ME modules - why? Because to put it simply, ME is one of the most challenging degrees in this university, so doing a module run by another department is only likely to be easier. You will also be competing against students from other departments who will perhaps have undertaken less rigorous courses than ME. Horizons modules are believed to be easy to get a 2:1 in, but to get a 1st in them you will have to put in reasonable effort. With minimal effort, however, you should be able to secure a 2:1 in them. 

</p>

<!-- <p> -->
<!-- Business School modules generally satisfy all the definitions of ease. The coursework are usually very short, require minimal time, and you often get to work in groups of 6. Examples include writing a 600-word essay in a group of 6 for 10% of the module! There is a huge mismatch between the level of difficulty of coursework between ME and Business School modules. There is also generally much less content to learn than ME modules, and it is easy to score a good mark. -->
<!-- </p> -->


<!-- <p> -->
<!-- Fundamentals of Fracture Mechanics is a module that doesn’t have a very high mean mark every year, but if you are willing to work hard in this module, you will almost guarantee yourself a very high mark and can easily score above 80%. This is because there is a very good correlation between effort and mark obtained in this module, which actually isn’t the case in a lot of modules. The mark scheme for the exam papers is literally almost entirely content from the lecture slides copy-pasted, therefore if you memorise all of the lecture slides, you can easily score very highly! The actual maths involved is straightforward, there isn’t too much content to learn and there is a lot of overlap with ME2 Materials.  -->
<!-- </p> -->

<h3>Usefulness</h3>
<p>Some modules are extremely useful in preparing you for what you might encounter in the future, be that in a job or a PhD, or in ME4. SDO, ECM and FEA are strong examples: SDO teaches you optimisation which is a very useful skill that may be very applicable in your final year project, or during your AA modules. ECM teaches you advanced coding and electronic skills that may open a whole new range of final year project options. FEA is used very commonly in the department and is found in numerous final year projects too, and helps with several of the AA modules too. 
</p>

<h3>M-level Modules</h3>
<p>If there is a certain m-level module that you are keen on doing, ensure that the modules you pick in ME3 do not prevent you from undertaking it in ME4 (see the department’s rules on modules). This is because there are fewer m-level modules to choose from than h-level, so there may only be a few that actually appeal to you and you do not want to end up doing something that you don’t enjoy especially if it is going to be more technically challenging. As well as this, in ME4 you have the option of taking IDX modules. ME students see them as a very exciting opportunity to learn something from a different department and field, different to what you have been studying for the first three years. As such they are very popular, and if doing an IDX module appeals to you, make sure you don’t prevent yourself from being able to take one that you like because of your ME3 modules.
</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Certain modules might sound very appealing and interesting on paper, but there are often certain aspects about them that make students ultimately dislike the module, so make sure you find out all the information that concerns you before selecting them. For example, this could be the quality of the resources (such as only lecture slides, no course notes), the nature of the lecturer, or a lack of structure to the course.
